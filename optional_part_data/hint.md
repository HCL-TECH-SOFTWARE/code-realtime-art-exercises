To add a frame port to a capsule, place the cursor after its initial `{` and press `ctrl+space`. Select the command **New Port**. Give the port a name (typically `frame`) and set its type to the predefined `Frame` protocol. The created port will by default be declared with the `service` keyword, which means that other capsules can send events to it. We don't want that for a frame port, so replace that keyword with `behavior` instead which makes it a non-service behavior port. Non-service means that only the capsule itself can use the port, and behavior means that any event that arrives on the port will be handled by the capsule's own state machine. Note, however, that the predefined `Frame` protocol doesn't define any events and we only use it for calling the functions it provides through the [`Frame::Base` API](https://secure-dev-ops.github.io/code-realtime/targetrts-api/class_frame_1_1_base.html).
